## configuration files 

On the next step, the Launchpad will scaffold out a set of configuration files appropriate to your chosen testing type, and the changes will be listed for you to review. For more information about the generated config check out the [Cypress configuration reference](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration), or you can just scroll down and hit "Continue".
